        Hi, I’m Ansh Bhatt, a full-stack developer and system design architect
        with a passion for creating impactful digital solutions. With a strong
        foundation in computer science from AKTU University, I specialize in
        building modern, scalable applications using React, Next.js, TypeScript,
        and the MERN stack. Over the years, I’ve led and contributed to diverse
        projects, from developing AI-driven financial advisors to creating
        seamless user interfaces. Beyond coding, I enjoy capturing cinematic
        moments through photography and videography. I’m always excited to explore new
        technologies and take on challenging projects. Let’s connect and bring
        ideas to life!
